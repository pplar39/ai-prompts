# ai-prompts

I wanted a place to share AI prompts and personas I find fun or useful — so here it is.

Some are practical, some are weird, all of them were actually used in real projects.

## Prompts

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| **EREBUS** | Code auditor that can't reject your code without evidence |
| **Steven Jjapielberg** | Hackathon video director — 60-second demo specialist |


*More coming soon.*

## Usage

1. Copy the prompt you want
2. Paste it as a system prompt (or custom instructions) in any LLM
3. Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.
